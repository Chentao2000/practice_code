So, what exactly is a histogram? A histogram represents
the distribution of pixel intensities (whether color or gray-
scale) in an image. It can be visualized as a graph (or plot)
that gives a high-level intuition of the intensity (pixel value)
distribution. We are going to assume an RGB color space in
this example, so these pixel values will be in the range of 0
to 255.
